Summary

Functions in Kotlin are first-class constructs and can be treated like data types.

Lambda expressions provide a shorthand syntax to write functions.

You can pass function types into other functions.

You can return a function type from another function.

A lambda expression returns the value of the last expression.

If a parameter label is omitted in a lambda expression with a single parameter, it's referred to with the it identifier.

Lambdas can be written inline without a variable name.

If a function's last parameter is a function type, you can use trailing lambda syntax to move the lambda expression after the last parenthesis when you call a function.

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters or return a function.

The repeat() function is a higher-order function that works similarly to a for loop.
